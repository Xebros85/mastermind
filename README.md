Welcome to Mastermind! 

This is my second object oriented program using Ruby.

What is Mastermind?
Players: One player (the computer) creates a secret code, and the other player (the human) tries to guess it.
Goal: The human player needs to guess the secret code within a certain number of attempts.
Key Components
Secret Code:

The computer generates a secret code made up of a specific number of colors (e.g., 4 colors from a selection like red, blue, green, etc.).
Guessing:

The player makes a guess by choosing a set of colors.
Feedback:

After each guess, the computer provides feedback:
Correct Positions: How many colors are correct and in the right spot.
Correct Colors: How many colors are correct but in the wrong spot.
Basic Steps of the Game
Setup:

The game starts with the computer creating a secret code.
Player's Turn:

The player is prompted to make a guess. They enter their choice of colors.
Check Guess:

The computer checks the player's guess against the secret code.
The computer provides feedback based on the guess.
Repeat:

The player continues guessing until they either guess the code correctly or run out of attempts.
End Game:

If the player guesses the code correctly, they win!
If they run out of attempts, the game reveals the secret code.
